Hi, I'm Dom. I'm a 20-something hobbyist programmer, advocate of open
source/free software, and interested in electronics.

In terms of software, you can see my Github profile [here][gh] and my projects
that I work on. I do have a habit of starting projects, and then ending up with
no time/motivation to work on it -- rest assured,that does not necessarily mean
I've given up on them.

I'm currently working on a home/life automation project which I've named
`APIS`, and studying towards a BTEC Higher National Certificate (L4)
 qualification in Computing.

I'm also a hobbyist photographer, and enjoy taking landscape & candid
photographs.

I work with the [South Devon Tech Jam][sdtj] as their Technical Lead, and
maintain infrastructure and support users with technical matters.
