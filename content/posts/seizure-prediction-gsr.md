Alright, so I've been working on my wrist-worn seizure detection design some
more. In terms of the GSR sensor _itself_, this is a bit more tricky that I
anticipated. Most, if not all, GSR sensor modules require electrodes on the
finger.

Whilst finger electrodes are more accurate than say, wrist electrodes, my
requirements are strict enough to ensure that the electrodes must be in contact
with the wrist, and the wrist **only**. The reason is to ensure a hands-free
device.

The only remaining option I have is to custom-design a GSR sensor module, in a
compact version in order to suit the requirements of a wrist-worn device.

Empatica's [Embrace 2](https://www.empatica.com/en-gb/embrace2/) has a series of
GSR sensors in a grid-layout on the bottom of the wrist device.
